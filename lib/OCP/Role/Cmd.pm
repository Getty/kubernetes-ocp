=synopsis

=description

A one-method role consumed by every C<OCP::Cmd::*> class.  Its only job
is to expose the root C<OCP> object so commands can reach the project
configuration without each command having to thread it through.

L<MooX::Cmd> composes commands into a chain (root, sub-command, sub-sub).
The root is always the first element; C<ocp> returns it directly, so
commands at any depth see the same C<OCP> instance.

=method ocp

    my $ocp = $self->ocp;

Returns the first element of the L<MooX::Cmd> C<command_chain>, i.e. the
root C<OCP> object.  Use it to read C<config> (path to C<ocp.yaml>) and
C<verbose>, and to share file/IO helpers (C<dump>, C<dump_file>,
C<load_file>) across commands.
